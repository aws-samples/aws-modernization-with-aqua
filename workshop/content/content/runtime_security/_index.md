# Module 3: Secure the Workloads

Aqua provides various runtime enforcement controls to ensure a strong security posture in production when the build artifacts are converted into running workloads.

You can use runtime policies to monitor and enforce controls at runtime, according to your organization’s security requirements. These controls range from blocking unregistered images to detecting drift in a container, as well as granularly blocking certain behavior during runtime.

# Learning Objective
