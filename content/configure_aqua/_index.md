Aqua Platform is a complete and comprehensive cloud-native security platform that secures existing workflows and workloads, facilitates regulatory compliance, enforces immutability, and captures security data for forensics. Together, Aqua and Amazon EKS provide a highly controlled environment that greatly reduces the attack surface before your application is even deployed, and automatically detects and responds to anomalies during runtime.

## Learning Objectives

In this section, we will set the foundation for the workshop by deploying the Aqua Platform on an Amazon EKS cluster.

* Install the AWS and Aqua tools
* Create the Amazon EKS cluster
* Obtain the Aqua license
* Deploy Aqua platform
