# Getting Started

{{< youtube 67V0j15ygaU >}}


To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

* ...[running the workshop on your own (in your own account)](/getting_started/self_paced.html), or
* ...[attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)](/getting_started/aws_event.html)

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with [**Create a Workspace**](/configure_environment/workspace.html)
