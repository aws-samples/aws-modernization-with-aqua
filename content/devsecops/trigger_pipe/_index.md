In order for the build to succeed, we can go to the **Aqua Console** and modify the **Assurance policy** that we created [previously](/devsecops/assurance).

Once you have modified the policy go back to the [CodePipeline in the Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines). On the details page for our CodePipeline, click on **Release Change** to trigger a new pipeline.

Notice this time, the pipeline succeeds.

Since the pipeline has succeeded, the application also has been successfully deployed to the Amazon EKS cluster. Check out the output of the following command in the Cloud9 IDE
```shell
kubectl get pods
```

You can also check out in the **Aqua Console** that the application has also been deployed, by clicking on Risk Explorer.
