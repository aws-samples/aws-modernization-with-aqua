## Forensics
Using the container forensics control, Aqua correlates the container actions to security policies and pinpoints the location and origin of the violations when they occur. Aqua further maps these violations to the appropriate MITRE tactics and techniques to better understand the attack surface and aid in their mitigation. 

For every event that Aqua detects or prevents during risk assessment and runtime, Aqua generates a detailed audit record that can be viewed on the Audit page (and which can be easily sent to external log collectors via many out-of-the-box integrations):

Navigate to ```Security Reports``` >  ```Audit```
