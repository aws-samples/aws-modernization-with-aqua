# Module 2: Secure ECR Registry
Most DevOps and security professionals would agree that it is both important as well as easier to secure containers early in their lifecycle. Aqua “shifts left” the security controls and applies them as part of the CI/CD pipeline - but it is as important to have continuous monitoring of all images to make sure that the production environment is kept secured as time goes by.
You can achieve this by integrating Aqua with Amazon ECR via the Integrations tab right from the Aqua Web console.
